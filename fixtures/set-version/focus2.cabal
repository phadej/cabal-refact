synopsis:
  A general abstraction for manipulating elements of container data structures
description:
  An API for construction of free-form strategies of access and manipulation of
  elements of arbitrary data structures.
  It allows to implement efficient composite patterns, e.g.,
  a simultaneous update and lookup of an element,
  and even more complex things.
  .
  Strategies are meant to be interpreted by the host data structure libraries.
  Thus they allow to implement all access and modification patterns of
  a data structure with just a single function,
  which interprets strategies.
  .
  This library provides pure and monadic interfaces,
  so it supports both immutable and mutable data structures.
